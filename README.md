# Your Blog Project

This is a web application that allows users to create and manage a collection of blogs. It provides features such as adding new blogs, viewing the blog collection, and an about us page to provide information about the blog team. The project uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and npm as the package manager.

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the MongoDB connection: Replace the database URL in `app.js` with your own MongoDB connection string.
4. Start the server: `nodemon app.js`
5. Access the application: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Home Page

The home page provides an overview of the blog collection, displaying the titles and snippets of the blogs. Users can click on a blog to view the full content.

### About Us Page

The about us page provides information about the blog team. It introduces the team members and their areas of expertise.

### Add Blogs Page

The add blogs page allows users to create and submit new blogs to the collection. It includes fields for the blog title, snippet, and body. Once submitted, the blog is stored in the MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code outside the web browser.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the blog collection data.
- npm: The package manager for Node.js that handles project dependencies.
